# TSF-Simple-Linear-Regression
Simple Linear Regression using python for student score dataset
In this regression model we will predict the percentage of marks/score that a student expected to get based on his/her number of hours of study.
This is a simple model as it has only two variables i.e. hours and score.
In this model we will be importing the necessary libraries and then train our dataset after that we will predict the score along with the accuracy of the model.
